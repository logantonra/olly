# Olly

A simple way to get a jump start on your day.

## TODO

**High Priority**

- [ ] Finish building the first olly physical device

**Mid Priority**

- [ ] Implement register a new device flow/ QR code login
- [ ] Re implement pre push linting

**Lower Priority**

- [ ] Make time update exactly at the minute
- [ ] Add testing with Jest
- [ ] Add server side caching to avoid rate limiting on weather and train APIs (can wait, only one customer at the moment)
- [ ] Add ci/cd with GitHub actions (can wait, only prod and local deployments at the moment)

  - currently only prod and local deployments to save on aws costs
  - Makefile based way to bring up / down a remote QA environment could be useful

- [ ] Add loading placeholders/ api error placeholders for train times and weather
- [ ] Add full description of what this app is and how to use it to README.md
